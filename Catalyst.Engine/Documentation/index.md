This is the Documentation for the Catalyst Engine, a 2D game engine and editor build ontop of an open source implementation of Microsoft's XNA framework, MonoGame.

*Disclaimer: This documentation is still in the works and may contain sections that are incomplete.*

This Catalyst Engine was build using an Entity Component System architecture, and the api is designed to allow for a clear interface between the underlying graphics implementation, scene structure, and GUI editor.

The goal is to enable faster 2D development, while giving the programmer full control of the inner functionality of the engine. As such, the Catalyst Engine was build such that everything from the main game loop, to the interface with the editor is fully editable and extendable.
